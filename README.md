I'm
Full Stack Solution Architect
The crossover between design and programming has always been of interest to me, I've been lucky enough to work alongside some talented teams on a number of high profile websites. I have a wide range of skills that include back-end development using open source technologies (NodeJs, Java), design (working closely with designers), front-end development (React, ReactJs, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript),database(MongoDB).
